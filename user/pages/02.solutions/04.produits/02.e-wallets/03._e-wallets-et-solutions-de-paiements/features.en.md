    description: 'Every payment programme is based on transactions and cash flows. In order to further streamline these transfers and electronic exchanges, we can develop your fleet of nominative e-wallets backed by your payment solution. Each holder of an e-wallet will be assigned his “virtual IBAN”. They will be able to make inbound or outbound transfers anywhere and at any time. They will also be able to issue connected payment media such as prepaid cards and thus have access to their funds in real time.'

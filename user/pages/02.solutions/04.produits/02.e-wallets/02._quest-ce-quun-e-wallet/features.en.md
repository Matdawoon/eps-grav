    description: 'An electronic wallet is a digital pocket. Also known under the name of virtual wallet, it is a virtual storage which, like a bank account without being one, will allow you to manage monetary flows (inflows and outflows of money: payments, transfers, refunds ...). Secure and uncapped, it has managed to adapt to any connected medium and allow instant currency exchanges. Your digitized money follows you everywhere.'

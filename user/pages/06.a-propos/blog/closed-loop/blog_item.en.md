![What is a closed loop payment card?](closed-loop-e-pay-space.jpg)

The "Closed Loop" is an anglicism widely used in development to evoke a system literally designed in "closed circuit". Often designed to be self-contained, closed circuits are processes which aim to reduce outside interference.
In the field of payment cards and more particularly prepaid cards, the indication "closed loop" determines a restricted field of use. In fact, unlike an "open loop" payment card which can be used on an open and multi-brand network (this is also the case for most bank cards); a “closed loop” card will be limited. For example, it can only be used in a particular store, or only within a group of brands.

**Why choose closed loop payment cards?**
Closed loop payment systems are based on payment programs generally designed by Program Managers or banks for defined uses. It is notably a very popular format for cultural or sporting events. For example, during a festival, festival-goers may be given contactless payment bracelets that can only be used within the festival grounds. Beyond the virtualization of entry tickets, their users will be able to make payments for drinks, food, goodies or even access to entertainment during the festival. They will be able to top up their bracelets via a mobile application and not have cash or their own credit cards with them throughout the event.
This is a clear advantage for the end user who has a unique, fluid and simplified consumption experience, but also for the organizers who benefit from a dematerialized currency thus avoiding fraud and errors.

But beyond events, a closed loop payment card makes perfect sense, especially as part of a loyalty program or a gift card. A brand can perfectly well offer its customers a payment card that can only be used in its stores and those of its partners. The card cannot therefore be used in other brands. To this can be added advantages such as discounts on loyalty points, cashback on the card or targeted promotional offers ... a whole range of marketing actions with strong growth potential.

Note that the closed loop format applies to physical payment cards, virtual payment cards, but also any medium based on a personalized payment program. The main thing is to define upstream of your project the contours of your payment program and the desired usage limits with your <span class="link-blog-simple"><a href="https://www.epayspace.com/fr/ressources/blog/program-manager">Programme Manager</a></span>.
